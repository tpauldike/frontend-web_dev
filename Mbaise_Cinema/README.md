# Mbaise Cinema

I built this web application while trying to see how I could solve real life problems with what I had learned in `html`, `css` and `javascript` at the time. I needed to practice well enough, so as to build my skills and confidence as a competent **Software Developer**

The project is a landing page for some non-existent cinema ***Mbaise Cinema***; it has:
- a fixed background image
- some form with a responsive *Submit* button
- a search bar to search for movies that are available for download
- a gallery of movies to be shown
- the nav buttons hidden in a drop-down menu named Menu, *and more*
